    <h1>Site Plan: Music Studio</h1>

    <h2>Site Name</h2>
    <p><strong>Harmony Studios</strong></p>
    <p>Reason: This name was chosen because it evokes a sense of energy and passion associated with music. The "Crimson Wave" imagery suggests a powerful, flowing sound, while "Studios" clearly indicates the nature of the business. It's memorable and aligns with our reddish color scheme.</p>

    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>The Harmony Studios website will serve as a comprehensive platform to showcase the studio's services, state-of-the-art equipment, and featured artists. It will provide detailed information about the facilities, booking options, and serve as a digital portfolio to attract new clients and collaborators in the music industry. The site aims to convey the studio's professional capabilities while also capturing the creativity and passion inherent in music production.</p>

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What types of recording services does Harmony Studios offer, and what are their rates?</li>
        <li>Can I see examples of previous work or a list of artists who have recorded at this studio?</li>
        <li>What specific recording and mixing equipment is available at Harmony Studios?</li>
    </ol>
